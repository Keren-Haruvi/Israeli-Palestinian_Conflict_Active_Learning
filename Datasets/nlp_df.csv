3,exploration,train,"The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.

Say that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight.

I don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say ""Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing."" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.

So the viewpoint I am trying to get changed is this: If the Israelis were in the shoes of the Palestinians, they'd behave the same. And in fact, most people in the world would, too.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4,4,3,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
4,exploration,train,"Firstly, before the 'war', Antizionists became antizionists because they viewed Israel as a colonial project, an apartheid state and beleived that people in Gaza lived in an open air prison. You may disagree with that characterisation but you have to admit that zionsism at least resembles a colonial project, the west bank resembles apartheid and gaza resembles an open air prison. It may not actually be any of those things but it is pretty obvious why some people characterise it this way. Even if you disagree with the framing, you have to see why some people might see it that way.

Furthermore, Israel is not being held to a standard other countries are not held too. I can't think of another country where two sets of people live on the same land but one group lives under martial law (the west bank) and has essentially different freedoms of movements and laws applied to them. I mean this obviously occurred in South Africa and Jim Crow but these were rightfully denounced and abolished by the western world (eventually).

I can't think of another example of an area where an entire population (who are native to the land) are put into (what could be considered) an open-air prison like Gaza. Maybe north korea but not like they're very popular in the west.

There are other countries that started as colonial projects (Australia, South Africa and many north/south American countries) but they do not still persecute the native people as much as the Palestinians are persecuted today. The countries mentioned don't have anything that resembles an open air prison, the indigenous people's movements are not restricted in the same way and the natives don't live under martial law. Is there discrimination in these countries against the native people? Of course. But these native people have far more freedom than Palestinians. The native people in these countries are also not still being forcefully displaced (at least in countries like the US and Australia but maybe you could make this argument for Brazil when the fascist cunt Bolsanaro was in power).

Now most people who are showing support for the Palestinians today are doing so because of this 'war'. In comparison, Palestinians protests were much much smaller before the 'war' and most people weren't any more invested in the Palestinians than any other persecuted people.

Analogously, the US did horrible things to the Native Americans to form the country - war, massacres, broken treaties, etc...

-Israel was warned, but ignored/dismissed intel from Egypt and the US that an attack was imminent

-Israel has arguably the best intelligence agency in the world. Surely armed men training on motorbikes with parachutes attached would have come across their radar

-Guards who were stationed at the border post where Hamas entered, had sent reports to the highest-ranking intelligence officer in the southern command weeks before, warning of unusual activity, but the reports were ignored

I believe that Israel wanted any reason to enter a war with Hamas, so that they could access Gaza. Hamas' attack was brutal and horrific. This gave Israel the opportunity to strike almost any target they wanted to, without concern for civilian casualties, if they reported Hamas was nearby.

Palestinians were told to leave Gaza, but given nowhere to go. Still Israel dropped bombs.

Documents have now come out of the Israeli Parliament, outlining plans for a temporary tent city on the Sinai Peninsula for displaced Palestinians, with the long term goal of making it permanent.

I personally believe this has all been masterfully played by Israel, as a way of taking back the small but holy landmark of the Dome of the Rock.

26,evaluation,train,"A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.

When Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. Source

So, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:

Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.

The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestry is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. Source: (mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources compiled into a database summarized in this thread).

In light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:

You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long persecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians?

“The thesis according to which the danger of genocide hung over us in June 1967, and according to which Israel was fighting for her very physical survival, was nothing but a bluff which was born and bred after the war.” Mattityahu Peled, Spring of 1972.
“Israel was never in real danger and there was no evidence that Egypt had any intention of attacking Israel.” .... “Israeli intelligence knew that Egypt was not prepared for war.” Mattityahu Peled, radio programme.
“There was no danger of annihilation. Neither Israeli headquarters nor the Pentagon – as the memoirs of President Johnson proved – believed in this danger.” Chaim Herzog, same programme.
“All those stories about the huge danger we were facing because of our small territorial size, an argument expounded once the war was over, have never been considered in our calculations. While we proceeded towards the full mobilisation of our forces, no person in his right mind could believe that all this force was necessary to our ‘defence’ against the Egyptian threat. This force was to crush once and for all the Egyptians at the military level and their Soviet masters at the political level. To pretend that the Egyptian forces concentrated on our borders were capable of threatening Israel’s existence does not only insult the intelligence of any person capable of analysing this kind of situation, but is primarily an insult to the Israeli army.” Mattityahu Peled, Le Monde, June 3rd, 1972.

It went this way: We would send a tractor to plow some area where it wasn't possible to do anything, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to shoot. If they didn't shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance farther, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and shoot. And then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and that's how it was.'' Moshe Dayan, same conversation.

The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem.

Back in 1977 before the current narrative of infantilized Palestine was a thing the leader of the major ruling political party of Palestine the PLO, of which Fatah is a part, had this to say about what Palestine was.

�The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan. -Zuheir Mohsen, PLO leader

From: �Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden,� James Dorsey, Trouw, 31 March 1977

The Jewish residency in the area is well documented in the literature from the Roman Empire, the best source being Josephus (but also Strabo, Cicero, and other historians and philosophers of the time). The name Palestine is actually originally Roman- Palestina- which the Romans named the area previously known as Judea before the Romans quelled the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Dead Sea scrolls are scrolls found from that time period that discuss Jewish life in the region.

The archaeology record goes back even further. Pottery shards with early Hebrew writing have been found that go back to the 8th century BCE.

The archaeology record for the British, Spanish, and other colonial projects start when they first came there. They didn't have documented anywhere in their cultural writings about living there in previous years.

She was the only survivor and you can hear her calling the Red Crescent for help. The IDF blocked any help from reaching her, and when they did allow 2 Red Crescent (a humanitarian organisation) to rescue her, they bombed their ambulance. Hind died in the car, murdered by IDF soldiers. A 6 year old. This story stuck with me because I am in the Red Cross (same organisation as the Red Crescent) and killing humanitarian workers (which we are, and we are all trained medics) is in violation of the Geneva convention. Not to mention Israels actions and threats to Rafah. You don't get to create a huge refugee camp, claim citizens will be safe and then bomb them. 

The Flour Massacre also comes to mind. It is suspicious that Israel pushes the 'IDF felt threatened by advancing civillians so fired warning shots causing a stampede' story, then refuses to allow any external investigation. There is too much that doesn't add up to convince me that there was no use of cruel and disproportionate force. 

IDF and their sympathisers mocking Palestinians who are suffering on social media also paints the IDF in a bad light.

Israel's economic problems during that time have been sited by some historians as a major reason for desiring a war with the Arabs. A war would distract people's minds from unemployment and the low growth rate and would also bring in foreign money to boost the economy.21 
During the 1950s and early 1960s, Israel had enjoyed a booming economy. In addition, Germany was providing Israel with money as compensation for the Nazis' crimes; by 1964 about $850 million were directed into the Israeli state treasury.22However, in the year 1966, Israel's economy went into a period of recession. The Israeli government announced economic restraint policies which caused a drastic decrease in Israel's large construction industry, the closing of many factories, and high unemployment.23Unemployment reached 12.8%, the highest since the establishment of the Israeli State.24Many businesses went bankrupt. Investment in construction fell by 30% and in industry by 20%, creating a sharp rise in prices and a lack of money in the hands of the working class and consumers.25 The growth rate was less than 1% and inflation was 8%.26 
In response to this, the Israeli government denounced workers who demanded pay raises and praised a group of professors who agreed to accept lower wages.27The working class in Israel organized many strikes and large demonstrations in this period; Jewish workers arranged 277 strikes in 1966 alone.28 
In February 1967, the Minister of Labor Yigal Allon reported to the Israeli Cabinet that the rate of unemployment had increased by 10%, and that the immigration to Israel had dropped: ""for only 15,000 Jews have come to Israel in 1966, which meant that the Jews of the world have lost their enthusiasm towards the Land of Israel"". 29On the other hand, the immigrants coming to Israel, expecting a better life, were faced with unemployment. There had to be another way to regain their attention. Therefore, Israel began to provoke the neighboring Arab countries to make the world believe that there was a serious threat that Israel might be attacked by its Arab neighbors, and thus, not taking the blame for starting a war in the region.

190,part3,train,"A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.

When Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. Source

So, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:

Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.

The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestry is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. Source: (mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources compiled into a database summarized in this thread).

In light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:

You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long persecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians? They werent the ones to persecute them in europe, so they dont have to atone for the mistakes and atrocities of europeans with their land and lives.

Israel under Netanyahu also allowed suitcases of Qatari money to be given to Hamas in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire. These policies were called out in an editorial published one day after the October 7 attacks in The Times of Israel
, an Israeli online newspaper. The editorial referred to Israel's policies for dealing with Hamas as ""blowing up in our faces"".

Netanyahu has always denied propping up Hamas, but has been reported as saying at a Likud party conference in 2019: ""Anyone who wants to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support strengthening Hamas"".

As far back as 2009, Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, told the Wall Street Journal, �Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel�s creation.�

While there's no conclusive proof that Israel has been propping up Hamas, and possibly never will be, the volume of accusations from credible sources suggests that this is the case. And in that case, I would suggest that the responsibility for Hamas' actions, particularly anything requiring funding such as a large-scale terror attack, ultimately lies with Netanyahu and the Israeli government.

Jordan as a country was not founded until 1946, only two years before Israel. And, in fact, was part of the Palestine mandate under British control following WWI. Under Turkish rule, there was no such thing as Jordan. The Jordanians were in Palestine, and thus were Palestinian. This area was an Arab state, run by the Ottoman Empire. It gained freedom following WWI as part of the Great Arab Revolt, not as a Palestinian state, which is important to note. This, as you can see, calls into question the entire basis of Palestinians being a separate people. Not to mention the fact that, in 1878, Ottoman figures put the number of Palestinians at 400,000. This figure did not significantly change until a rise in the Jewish population (who improved and worked land that hadn't been touched for centuries), made living conditions much better, and thus led to a commensurate rise in the Arab population, mostly due to immigration from nearby countries.

You may disagree with that characterisation but you have to admit that zionsism at least resembles a colonial project, the west bank resembles apartheid and gaza resembles an open air prison. It may not actually be any of those things but it is pretty obvious why some people characterise it this way. Even if you disagree with the framing, you have to see why some people might see it that way. Furthermore, Israel is not being held to a standard other countries are not held too. I can't think of another country where two sets of people live on the same land but one group lives under martial law (the west bank) and has essentially different freedoms of movements and laws applied to them. I mean this obviously occurred in South Africa and Jim Crow but these were rightfully denounced and abolished by the western world (eventually). I can't think of another example of an area where an entire population (who are native to the land) are put into (what could be considered) an open-air prison like Gaza. Maybe north korea but not like they're very popular in the west. There are other countries that started as colonial projects (Australia, South Africa and many north/south American countries) but they do not still persecute the native people as much as the Palestinians are persecuted today. The countries mentioned don't have anything that resembles an open air prison, the indigenous people's movements are not restricted in the same way and the natives don't live under martial law. Is there discrimination in these countries against the native people? Of course. But these native people have far more freedom than Palestinians. The native people in these countries are also not still being forcefully displaced (at least in countries like the US and Australia but maybe you could make this argument for Brazil when the fascist cunt Bolsanaro was in power). Now most people who are showing support for the Palestinians today are doing so because of this 'war'.

The accord was to be implemented within five years. Since then, Israel multiplied its illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank, expropriated land and water resources, added more than 500 checkpoints, imprisoned thousands of Palestinians without a trial process, and took every step to deny the Palestinians their own statehood.

It gained freedom following WWI as part of the Great Arab Revolt, not as a Palestinian state, which is important to note.

342,part3,test,"A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.

When Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. Source

So, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:

Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.

The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestry is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. Source: (mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources compiled into a database summarized in this thread).

In light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:

You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long persecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians? They werent the ones to persecute them in europe, so they dont have to atone for the mistakes and atrocities of europeans with their land and lives. If someone owes to compensate them then they should be europeans specifically germans. Why didn't they give them a piece of their land to build a Jewish-majority state?

You dont view palestinians as equal humans and thus you think it is okay to take away their rights to solve the jewish problem of europe without europeans being affected that much; a �small� price to pay for salvation.

From what I have seen recently it seems that most pro-israel westerners have the combination of both points with the emphasis on the dehumanization of palesteninans; because if you (european and americans) sympathized with the jews, then the centuries-old persecution of jews that climaxed in their genocide in europe wouldn't have happened in the first place and you would have accepted them in your countries instead of easing and encouraging their immigration to the middle east from europe even after the holocaust.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]",2,4,2,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]"

Arafat refused, digging his heels in a demanded Israel give up its territorial integrity by demanding Israeli citizenship for millions of Palestinians in the so called right of return, which is an obvious non starter.

With Palestine unwilling to make steps towards two state, Israel did something rather interesting: it decided to simply unilaterally run a test of two different approaches: giving Palestine total control and their own state (Gaza), and a slow integration into one state (WB).

In the two decades that followed, Gaza continued to radicalize and spent its resources building tunnels and shooting rockets at Israel.

Significantly more non-combatants have been killed by Israel than Palestine or Hamas. 3803 vs 177. Israel has killed incomparably more civilians.

in that thread at 11:47am (PST), 07 Oct, that Israel was bombing residential apartment buildings, justifying it as saying that Hamas leaders were in the residential buildings.

That was an excuse the US military never made even once during its long anti-terrorism war. Accidents happened, but the deliberate targeting of residential buildings never happened.

He is not the sovereign in the territory held in belligerent occupation (see The Beit Sourik Case, at p. 832). His power is granted him by public international law regarding belligerent occupation. The legal meaning of this view is twofold: first, Israeli law does not apply in these areas. They have not been ""annexed"" to Israel. Second, the legal regime which applies in these areas is determined by public international law regarding belligerent occupation (see HCJ 1661/05 The Gaza Coast Regional Council v. The Knesset et al. (yet unpublished, paragraph 3 of the opinion of the Court; hereinafter � The Gaza Coast Regional Council Case). In the center of this public international law stand the Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, The Hague, 18 October 1907 (hereinafter � The Hague Regulations). These regulations are a reflection of customary international law. The law of belligerent occupation is also laid out in IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949 (hereinafter � the Fourth Geneva Convention).""

I mean this obviously occurred in South Africa and Jim Crow but these were rightfully denounced and abolished by the western world (eventually). I can't think of another example of an area where an entire population (who are native to the land) are put into (what could be considered) an open-air prison like Gaza. Maybe north korea but not like they're very popular in the west. There are other countries that started as colonial projects (Australia, South Africa and many north/south American countries) but they do not still persecute the native people as much as the Palestinians are persecuted today. The countries mentioned don't have anything that resembles an open air prison, the indigenous people's movements are not restricted in the same way and the natives don't live under martial law. Is there discrimination in these countries against the native people? Of course. But these native people have far more freedom than Palestinians. The native people in these countries are also not still being forcefully displaced (at least in countries like the US and Australia but maybe you could make this argument for Brazil when the fascist cunt Bolsanaro was in power). Now most people who are showing support for the Palestinians today are doing so because of this 'war'.

Amazingly, even a paramilitary terror organization like Haganah wouldn't stoop as low as today's IDF by bombing mosques:
