SnooOpinions8790,"There is no entirely good side because both ""sides"" as usually presented are patchwork quilts of factions. There are some reasonably good factions and some intolerably bad factions. Where I would like you to modify your view is by viewing this as simplistic flag-waving ""sides""  - that view is part of the reason this is so intractable.  The real extremists among the settlers are pretty intolerable and are a major obstacle to peace.   Hamas and some other militant groups that define themselves by a refusal of peace are intolerable precisely because its impossible to make peace with them - their whole reason for existing would cease if they were to consider peace.   So rather than blatant flag-waving anyone who actually cared about peace should be carefully choosing who exactly to support and who exactly to oppose.  There are factions who seek peace but the lack of strong internal and external support for them has made peace impossible. The simplistic taking of sides has itself been an obstacle to peace. Supporting Israel's right to exist should not mean turning a blind eye to the crimes of the extremists, it should mean supporting those within Israel who seek a just peace. Supporting the right of Palestinians to have a decent life should not mean indiscriminately supporting groups who claim to fight for them, it should mean supporting those who seek a just peace.  We should view ""Willing to try to live alongside the other people"" as its own side in this long standing conflict and if we care for ordinary people this is the side we should support - there are such factions within both Israeli and Palestinian society.

JackRusselTerrorist,"I think the “good side” is the civillians, even if they believe things we don’t agree with.  I’m a Jew, ethnically, and I’m pretty pro-Israel, in that I believe it has a right to exist, to defend itself, and that it’s actions in Gaza since 2005 are generally justified(though not every single thing they do there).  I also hate Netanyahu, and his far right party, and the further-right parties that help prop him up. I hate the settlers, and their terrorist actions in the West Bank.  I hate the cowardly Hamas leadership, and I think Abbas is a waffling two faced dipshit who’s complicit in the subjugation of his people in the West Bank while appeasing the radicals with his martyrs fund.  Between those three entities, the leadership in the area is a complete disaster.   But the people themselves? They could coexist, but a lot of work needs to be done to repair the relationships.  They don’t deserve the shit that’s happening. While many Palestinians are against a 2-state solution, especially those in Gaza, I can’t fault them for that. They grow up on a steady diet of propaganda thanks to the UNRWA schools, and Israel’s biggest presence in their life is as an aggressor, even if they’re generally just responding to Hamas attacks.  Even Hamas soldiers… they’re a perfectly predicable reaction to the situation, and I feel like many of the more rabid pro-Israeli people I see on this site would wind up in their ranks if they grew up in Gaza.

,">But violence is not only ugly, it also does not work. Can you imagine if Gandhi or MLK had taken beheaded hostages or kidnapped athletes or bombed a crowded bus, the retribution taken upon their followers and the populations they claimed to represent would have been swift and terrible.  I'll just pick this out and hopefully, I can change your view on this. Violence has worked in the past, especially during the peak of anti-colonial nationalism we saw after WW2. Plenty of countries, Indonesia, Kenya, Algeria, the Arab Revolt etc...engaged in a violent armed struggle against their colonial/imperial powers and were successful in achieving their political goals. Some of the more recent examples are the IRA and ANC, who managed to bring about political change through violent and non-violent means. This is what the PLO was founded on in the 60s. They modelled themselves after many anti-colonial armed groups around the world, many of which engage in terrorism themselves. Using violence to fight against a violent colonial state (which Israel absolutely was in the 60s) was often justified.   That being said, the violence that we saw on Oct 7th was not just violent but also barbaric in a way that loses all anti-colonial justification for violence.",1699187640,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",209,israel

Horatio87,"""Good"" is subjective. Being affiliated with either side by lineage or religion, what I see is a rabid minority bent on the total annihilation of an entire people, otherwise known as genocide. The fact that anyone wants to draw some form of moral equivalence between Hamas butchering people at a music festival and Palestinians being killed by airstrikes as Hamas uses them as human shields is absurd on its face.  The charter for Hamas calls for the complete eradication of Israel and her people, does the Israeli Constitution call for the destruction of Arab muslims residing in the Levant or elsewhere? Israel allows Arabs to live be citizens of their nation, own land, vote and hold public office, what nation along Israel's borders would offer the same for Jews? What war has Israel fought where it has been the aggressor?   Finally it is all well and good to tout the two state solution but the reality is that any concession the Israeli government makes, short of national suicide, will ever be enough to end the violence. Until the Palestinians police their own and refuse to be used as cannon fodder by groups like Hamas there will be no lasting peace. The only guaranteed outcome of this Israeli-Hamas conflict is that a lot of good and innocent people on both sides will be killed because of the Hamas terror organization.",1699231713,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",232,israel
,"I want to argue specifically to the Jewish claim to the area based off the Bible.   Ignore the Bible. Doesn't matter.   The Jewish residency in the area is well documented in the literature from the Roman Empire, the best source being Josephus (but also Strabo, Cicero, and other historians and philosophers of the time). The name Palestine is actually originally Roman- Palestina- which the Romans named the area previously known as Judea before the Romans quelled the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Dead Sea scrolls are scrolls found from that time period that discuss Jewish life in the region.  The archaeology record goes back even further. Pottery shards with early Hebrew writing have been found that go back to the 8th century BCE.   The archaeology record for the British, Spanish, and other colonial projects start when they first came there. They didn't have documented anywhere in their cultural writings about living there in previous years.   The Jewish claim to the area has nothing to do with settler colonialism and everything about being indigenous. This obviously doesn't undermine the Palestinian claim- the two claims coexist.",1699192108,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",192,israel
Upper-Ad6308,"*""Can you imagine if Gandhi or MLK had taken beheaded hostages or kidnapped athletes or bombed a crowded bus, the retribution taken upon their followers and the populations they claimed to represent would have been swift and terrible.""*  Actually, the violence and unrest in the Civil Rights era (e.g. riots) was massive, and there were a heck of a lot of deaths on both sides. Not to mention, a lot of criminal activity among certain African American individuals is largely a personal response to their past issues with discrimination. We don't hear much about it, because the mass media was largely on the side of the African American minority as early as the 1950's.  Through these riots and disorderly behavior, white Americans were forced to accept that the problem of African Americans was also OUR PROBLEM.  So, I would argue that the American Civil Rights situation is somewhat similar to the Palestinian situation.  It is hard to escape the harsh reality that a little bit of coercion is usually necessary to move a staunch adversary.",1699240255,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",179,palestine

MedicinalBayonette,"Occupied people have the right to resist their occupation and its understood that they will do so in irregular manners. If an occupied people could form a coherent military force then they likely aren't occupied and can act as a state. Palestine is not sovereign. It's territory is occupied, it's people are subject to displacement from a military force and basic resources like water and electricity are controlled by their occupier. Resistance in this case makes sense.  I would compare the situation more to Northern Ireland. The Irish conflict was a brutal and bloody affair that lasted for decades between two sides that had to co-habitate the same area. There was a resolution that came in the Good Friday Accords that provided a way for both groups to live together without fear of one side oppressing the other. It created new institutions comprised of people from both sides of the conflict. And it created a porous border that allowed for regional autonomy but not a hard stop on the flow of people and goods.   Essentially, a similar agreement is required that allows Palestinians to exercise the right of self-determination and guarantees Israel security in its own position. Many iterations of this have been tried, including the Oslo Accords. Israel has not respected these deals and after the assassination of Rabin, continued a policy of aggressive settlement in the West Bank and has essentially held Gaza under prison conditions since the IDF pulled out. There is no way to see Israels actions as a good faith. Without good faith on putting these agreements into place, moderate parties in Palestine lose credibility. Through negotiation and compromise these policies haven't created better conditions for Palestine. Things only get worse. So it's no surprise that violent factions would gain support. This is the fault of Likud. Their policies have made the prospect of peaceful settlement less and less likely. This inflames the conflict. Only good faith engagement in the peace process by Israel can ease hostilities.   While the actions of Hamas are clearly awful, they are the actions of a group trying to resist occupation. Resistance movements are almost always chaotic and violent. But fundamentally, these movements gain political power because their occupier makes no concessions driving more and more people to aggressive and radical positions.",1699239063,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",387,palestine
shotgundraw,"You are wrong. An oppressor does not have the right to defend itself from the oppressed. People yelling about Hamas seem not to see the irony of the French resistance in WW2 killing their oppressor the Nazis.   What is on display here is extreme privilege. Unless you’ve grown up as the oppressed and/or had people in your family murdered for speaking out against the oppressor, you frankly have no semblance of what you are talking about.   I am the first generation in my family who has not had a family member living under oppression and or had a family member murdered in several generations. I am Caucasian , which makes it more shocking because Caucasians are leading every genocide.    You think Hamas magically appeared out of nowhere? Hamas was created and funded by Israel in response to the PLO.   The right wing of Israel and Netanyahu were responsible for the murder of Yitzhak Rabin simply because he wanted peace and the co-existence of everyone in the area.   As an Ashkenazi Jew the state of Israel is an affront to essence of Judaism. The fact that Israeli UN Member had the unmitigated gall to wear gold stars to a UN meeting is an absolute desecration to the memory of Holocaust victims as well as an the worse insult to Holocaust survivors.   That alone should tell how depraved Netanyahu and those supporting Israel are.   They murdered Israeli citizens with tanks on 10/7 and blamed it on Hamas. They even twisted the baby burning an oven story despite that actually occurring at the hands of an Israeli soldier to a Palestinian baby in 1948.   They’ve tried to justify bombing hospitals and refugee camps claiming both that Hamas is hiding in underground tunnels and hiding amongst the public, which contradicts their narrative that they care about human life.   Do you see any Palestinians making TikToks mocking dead Israelis? Do you see any rubble in the background when Israelis post to social media?

Sonyex,">Let’s start with Israel. Displacing an indigenous population with settlers is a real 17th century move. What the fuck did you expect when you opened up a “safe haven” for Jewish people in the Middle East? And your claim that the Bible gives this venture legitimacy to some ""promised land for Jews"" is just laughable. The Bible also says that a guy put two of every species of a wooden boat, the Bible says that a lady turned into a pillar of salt. I don’t think that the Bible is a valid document for making political claims.   Your premise here is wrong. There were both Jews and Arabs in Palestine preceding the establishment of the state. Under the Peal Plan and the UN approved plan, there would have been no one displaced. The Jewish state would have been 2/3rds Jewish and the arab state 2/3rds Arab.

Writer1999,"I think we should view it less in terms of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ and more in terms of ‘more powerful’ or ‘less powerful’. That is to say, what are both sides capable of militarily? Are they on equal footing or is one clearly more powerful? And I think the obvious answer to this question is: there aren’t on equal footing. However evil Hamas is (and to be clear, I don’t like Hamas), they are minuscule compared to the capabilities of Israel. And I would argue that the party with more power has more responsibility because they their actions have greater consequences. The more powerful party can cause more harm or significant decrease the harm depending on what they decide to do.   This is why I spend most of my time on this issue criticizing Israel. Israel should be using this power responsibly and it’s not. It’s increasing the carnage by the day. Hamas did start this round of conflict and is responsible for its actions. But we mustn’t conflate the Palestinian cause with the group Hamas. The cause is far greater than Hamas and not all Palestinians support Hamas. But besides that, I am an American. My tax dollars are not going to Hamas killing innocent Israelis. My tax dollars are, in fact, going to kill innocent Palestinians. To add icing on the cake, my tax dollars are going to a fellow democracy that is killing innocent Palestinians. I realize democracy in Israel is a fragile thing, but bear with me. Whether this is true in practice or not, people hold democracies to higher standards. Democracies are suppose to be at the forefront of fighting for freedom, equality, human rights and so forth. Many democracies seem to fail on this score sadly. But for those of us who believe in democracy as the ideal, should we not point out when a fellow democracy is doing atrocious things? A democracy is supposed to fight for everyone to one degree or another. Democracies are suppose to rise above old institutions that held people back or even deprived them of citizenship or humanity.

Love-Is-Selfish,">Let’s start with Israel.  Displacing an indigenous population with settlers is a real 17th century move.   Except Israelis legitimately bought land and legitimately took land in wars of self-defense as necessary for self-defense. So no, they didn’t immorally displace Palestinians. Any fault from being displaced during war lies on the initiators, the many surrounding Arab nations who started those wars and on the Palestinians who took part and supported those wars.  Edit: I’m sure you can find instances where Israel violated rights, but there’s really no comparison to the Palestinians. 
>After forcibly removing the local Palestinian population the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations, essentially mirroring what white settlers did to native populations in North America.  Is it any surprise that people are pissed off, that this has resulted in a lot of violence and death?  Could there have been any other outcome?  Maybe they should have tried what South Africa did in the 1990s, instead of doubling down on apartheid and oppression.    Edit: Also, if the Palestinians had any respect for their own rights, and subsequently the rights of Israelis, then they’d be clamoring to join the country in that region that would respect their rights the most, Israel. Israel would welcome them. But there are not enough Palestinians who love their own lives more than they want to kill the Jews or obey a non-existent god. It’s not Israel that’s confining Gazans, it’s Gazans acting as such that Egypt and Israel close their borders to them. Though, many Gazans work or worked in Israel, crossing the border every day.

There lived some Native people under a 400 year old emprie in Palestine.

They brought in about 375k people mainly from Europe over a 25-year period, eventually they armed and ethnically cleansed 750k of Natives and announced a government in 1948.   They kept expanding and pushing the Natives into concentration camps like Ghaza and it keeps going on.   It is a racially supremacist goverment with special rights for one race and second and third class citizen rights for others and no rights whatsoever for those cleansed from the land.  With support from the West it excersizes Apartheid and 100s of other human rights violations with impunity.  Since they have taken over almost the entire land the only solution will come in the form of the conversion of the racially supremacist structure into a non racial secular Republic with equal rights for all residents, Natives and those cleansed from the land.

PsychoSwede557,"Whatever your issues with the circumstances of Israel's initial establishment in 1948, the vast majority of the stagnation in the establishment of a Palestinian state has its origins either in the surrounding Arab states or within the Palestinian leadership.  In particularly their consistent rejection of the Partition resolution out of principle and their unwillingness to engage with Israel diplomatically for decades (The Khartoum Resolution and its 'Three Noes').  The most current issue is the 2007 Hamas-Fatah conflict, which is the only reason Gaza (and the West Bank) isn't a fully functioning independent state. This began when Hamas won a majority in the PLC and the two parties didn't want to compromise on power sharing and ended with Hamas forcibly taking control of the Gaza Strip and exiling Fatah to the West Bank, where they remain.  Part of this was because Fatah was willing to acknowledge Israeli sovereignty and negotiate somewhat, while Hamas wasn't.

Braincyclopedia,"While your point of view is valid, here are a few takes (from an Israeli). The reason for migration to Israel wasn't just religion. It was primarily to escape extinction, as europe was clearly no longer a safe option. Israel didn't conquer the land. It was given to them by the previous rulers, the british, due to the fact that they need a safe place, and not to the palestinians because they sided with the Nazis in the war. Next, Isrel didn't start the war of independe and therefore didn't conquer the land. The UN offered the palestinians a two land solution, and they refused. Then 5 different arab countries attacked the jews on the same day (the war of independence). The jews wanted to live with them in coexistence, but it was the arabs who chose violence. Consequentially, many of them ran abroad and lost their home. Basically, the jews at any point weren't the aggressors. They never came with an army to conquer the land. They were a group of holocaust survivors, who fought nazi supporters on their last stance for survival. The world is pissed at them for winning. With that being said, Israeli arabs are fully integrated into Israel society, and they have equal rights as any other citizens.   The issue came in 1967 Israel got caught in another war, in which they conquered the west bank and gaza. These were problematic regions that were already plagued with terrorism (originally targeted the Jordan and Egypt regimes). While the population share religion (Islam), nationality (arab), and borders with Gaza and the west bank, they wanted nothing to do with them. Egypt was willing to declare peace for the sinay peninsula, but they didn't want Gaza. So, Israeli inherited that sick place, which suddenly changed their guns to point toward Israel. Since then we are stuck in a war with them. Israel offered them peace many times, and each time they chose war instead.

SonOfShem,"The Israeli government has agreed to 2 of the last 3 two state solutions.  The Israeli government has consistently offered land for peace deals.  And yet people are still attacking them.  Is every action taken by them perfect?  Absolutely not.  Some of their 'strategic' actions have backfired stupendously, and they've their fair share of moral missteps.  But they don't actively use their own civilian population as human shields.  They don't actively target civilian centers unless soldiers are intermingling with the civilians for the express purpose of creating an international incident when they get bombed.  They don't use UN schools in the area as ammo deposits and fire rockets out of them at civilian targets.  As to the claims of ""displacing indigenous population"", that's hardly a reasonable take.  This is the Jews historical homeland (as proven by archeological evidence and ancient secular historians), and it was given to them to self govern after the land was taken from the ottomans in WWI.

VertigoOne,">After forcibly removing the local Palestinian population the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations, essentially mirroring what white settlers did to native populations in North America.   This isn't what happened.  First, there had been continuous indigenous communities of Jews in what has become Israel for centuries. They were small, but persistent.   Second, when the first Jewish communities of migrants arrived in the 1860s they didn't displace anyone. They bought empty land that was owned by Egyptian and Syrian absentee landlords, and proceeded to make it into real communities. This is where Tel Aviv comes from.  Third, the displacement from the war was open to being reversed. After the 1947-8 war of Israeli independence, the new Jewish state offered to let the Palestinians return provided they accepted Israeli statehood and agreed to renounce violence against Israel and become peaceful/productive citizens.

EmpatheticFirst,"During WW1, the Germans were courting the Mexican government. The Zimmerman Telegram was intercepted by the United States. The message from the Kaiser to Mexico was clear. We will send substantial invasion force to Mexico for an attack on the United States across the Mexican border. At the wars end, Mexico could regain its lost territories. California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas would be eliminate as well as any other areas once part of Mexico. This is factual, a book written by Barbara Tuchman, who also wrote the Guns of August. JFK actually went to read over that book during the Cuban missile crisis. How wars start by accident. If that happened do you think it would be a good idea to let Mexico draw a new border deep into the USA? What about Pearl Harbor? When we responded with the near decimation of Japans navy at Midway, should we have paused and tried to make peace? Or the English thinking of accepting terms from Germany in WW2?

Nope, but they fought a war to ensure the safety of their civilians and won.   You also seem to confuse the West Bank and Gaza Palestinians. WB lives alongside Israeli settlers and face most issues, Gaza from which Hamas operates  has 0 settlers.  My opinion on this is   a) Long term: Normalization and negotiations to form a Palestinian state in the West Bank, with a peace deal and general Israeli-Arab normalization  b) Short term: No ceasefire until hostages are released and Hamas surrenders. Terror cannot go unpunished   My gut feeling: if Israel and Palestine agree on ending the occupation and found Palestine, that's when the real war is gonna start.

Winter_Ad6784,"Let me clarify something first, the Bible is not the source of Israel's claim to the land. There were Jews living there under British Mandate Palestine. By 1947 about 5% of the Global Jewish population was living there.  As far as criticizing a country's history as a whole, there are no good countries. No one is perfectly innocent. Following British pulling out and Israel being declared upon by the Arab league Jews were expelled by all the surrounding Arab nations in the years following Israel's founding just as Arabs were expelled from Israel. Neither were right to do so.  The difference is that today about 20% of Israel's population is Arab/Muslim. They can live there peacefully and have been in parliament and been in the Supreme Court of Israel. About 0% of the surrounding Arab nation's populations are Jewish. They would be killed. Israel is a parliamentary democracy. Palestine hasn't had an election since 2006. The IDF does more to avoid civilian casualties than any military ever. Hamas's military base in Gaza is a civilian hospital. Israel could kill every person in Gaza of they wanted but choose not to. Hamas wants to kill every Jew but is unable. Israel wants to win so they can ensure this conflict never happens again. Hamas wants a ceasefire to ensure this conflict can happen again. Under Israel the Palestinians would be freer. Under Palestine the Israelis would be dead.  On a separate note, what you said about Ghandi is not entirely accurate. Ghandi's use of nonviolence was because they had no realistic means to actually fight. He himself said ""Had we adopted non-violence as the weapon of the strong, because we realized that it was more effective than any other weapon, in fact the mightiest force in the world, we would have made use of its full potency and not have discarded it as soon as the fight against the British was over or we were in a position to wield conventional weapons.

ButtchugSatan,"I pretty much align with a lot of your takes here, OP. This situation is much hairier than most - and I think it’s why most leftists really aren’t picking sides. (Yes, Fox news can always find Palestinian protesters to frame as left-representative, but who actually believes righty media these days?)  I dont want civilian casualties, I think Israel was a botched job being plopped in the middle east post-WWII without consideration to the local populations, I think Palestineans created this latest situation more than Israel by *electing fucking terrorists*, and I think the US largely knows we can’t tell Israel to do shit - because we sure as hell didnt listen to anyone on our decades-long romp through the Middle East.  It’s been long-fucked, and I think there are bad guys, badder guys, and the worst guys behind all this…so it’s something that I damn-near have no opinion on because to seriously try to pick a side would require the energy to effectively become a UN Official involved in this shit.",1699389719,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",174,not relevant

Mobile_Spirit8457,"You clearly mentioned it yourself verbatim that the Palestine people are the keywords “The ones being oppressed.” It’s very simple, again using your exact wording “After forcibly removing the local Palestinian population, the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations.” When someone is the aggressor, the reaction of the oppressed is the aggressors fault. To put into simpler terms, if you randomly go up to someone on the street and gently push them and they retaliate by stabbing you to death, your death was your own fault because you were the aggressor. Was the person who stabbed you in the wrong as well? Yes of course they overreacted.

Humanshavevalue,"This is definatley a very complex issue. What makes it harder to decipher is that there is a lot of history, religion, and politics at play. Yet no matter how complex an issue, it is important to remember to be able to find a comprehensive agreement without getting caught in the details. So many people hurl accusations at one another after seeing news flashes about this group or that group. But what happens when people or countries cant find peace or compromise? They go to war. It doesnt matter who is the weaker or stronger one. War means we want to elliminate you as there is no other solution to them. But what is worse is this is not just a war, its a genocide. The best way to tell the difference between a war and a genocide in my opinion is to see the motives and actions of each side. When we look at motives, we see the values of zionism as simply put, colonization. When we look at the actions, you probably already know. Multiple instances of bombing over the span of a few decades, resettlments, and occupation. Against who? The palestinian army ? Nope, who has heard of them. Not at all, but actually against civillians. Targeted for decades.   And please to everyone, this is not a jewish and muslim war. Neither side really represents either religion. Just like peaceful muslims all around the world have had to endure the desecration of their amazing religion by terrorists, i know that peacful jews are also having to face a similar situation thanks to zionists. Only its worse for jewish peope  because such insane aggression on this scale to only one isolated group of people (palestinian muslims and christians) is being bought into by almost all the worlds leaders. I must say jewish anti-zionists are the real heros of today along with the suffering palestinians they feel for. People who hold true to their sacred teachings and defend their basic values. These same jewish people and rabbis are attacked by the idf. This just shows how political zionism really is and devoid of judaism which it SAYS it stands for.",1704454937,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/,"CMV: There is no ""good side"" in the Israel - Palestine Conflict",364,palestine
